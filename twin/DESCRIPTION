Description: Estimating parameters of the Time-Window of Integration (TWIN)
model and simulating data for parameter sets under the model. Multisensory
integration of sensory information into a perceptual unit (event) occurs only
if the peripheral sensory processes all terminate within a given temporal
interval, the Time-Window of Integration (TWIN). Assumed are two stages. In the
first stage, there is a (stochastically independent) race among the peripheral
processes. The second stage comprises all processes following the first stage
including preparation and execution of a response. The parameters are the
processing times. Other parameters are the length of the TWIN and the amount of
integration. Data are reaction times.
